# Bug: Inactive proposers can still be scheduled

##  Bug Description

`NewSchedulerV1` (in `sched.go`) constructs a proposer schedule used to assign block-producing slots.
Its documentation states:

> *“If addr is not listed in proposers or not active, an error is returned.”*

However, the current implementation only checks if the proposer is **listed**, not whether they are **active**.
Specifically, the constructor appends the requested proposer into the `actives` slice even if `p.Active == false`:

```go
if p.Address == addr {
    proposer = p
    actives = append(actives, p) // ❌ added even if inactive
    listed = true
} else if p.Active {
    actives = append(actives, p)
}
```

As a result, inactive validators can still appear in the proposer rotation sequence and be assigned block production slots.

---

## Brief / Intro

A logic flaw in `NewSchedulerV1` allows **inactive or banned validators** to remain in the active scheduling sequence.
This means that even if a node is marked as inactive (offline, slashed, or banned), it can still be scheduled to produce blocks.
Such inclusion can lead to **chain stalls**, **missed blocks**, and **network liveness degradation**.

---

## Details

When constructing the proposer sequence, the function’s goal is to gather all active proposers and set the target proposer as the current node.
However, the implementation uses:

```go
if p.Active || p.Address == addr
```

This condition always adds the target proposer to the `actives` list, even if inactive.
Subsequent logic uses `actives` to determine proposer order and block timing, meaning an inactive proposer will receive valid block slots.

This contradicts both the comment and the intended design found elsewhere in the Go implementation.

---

### Example flow

1. A validator is deactivated (e.g., due to slashing or downtime).
   `p.Active = false`
2. `NewSchedulerV1` is called with that validator’s address as `addr`.
3. The constructor finds the matching proposer and appends it to `actives` unconditionally.
4. Scheduler proceeds as if the inactive proposer were active.
5. The inactive proposer is scheduled and fails to produce its block → liveness issue.

---

## Impact

If exploited or triggered:

* **Inactive proposers receive slots**, leading to:

  * Missed block production.
  * Reduced block throughput and potential finality delays.
* **Consensus liveness** may degrade, especially if multiple inactive proposers are incorrectly scheduled.
* **Potential griefing** vector:

  * A malicious validator could deliberately go inactive but still get scheduled, occupying slots and stalling the chain.
* **Reputation bypass**: A banned/flagged validator can still reappear in the schedule.

In short, **network liveness and reliability are at risk**, especially in permissioned or semi-permissioned PoA systems where proposer rotation is deterministic.

## Risk Breakdown (Immunefi Classification)

| Category                    | Assessment                                                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact**                  | High (consensus / liveness degradation)                   |
| **Likelihood**              | Medium (requires proposer to be listed but inactive)      |
| **Severity**                | **High**                                                  |
| **Exploitation difficulty** | Low — simple API call or consensus message can trigger it |
| **Assets affected**         | Chain liveness, validator fairness, consensus stability   |

---

## Recommendation

Implement a strict check for both listing and active status before constructing the scheduler:

```go
if !listed || !proposer.Active {
    return nil, errors.New("unauthorized or inactive block proposer")
}
```

This ensures:

* Inactive or banned validators cannot be scheduled.
* The `actives` slice reflects only genuinely active proposers.
* The function’s documented behavior matches the implementation.

You should also review `SchedulerV1.Updates()` to confirm it does not automatically re-enable inactive proposers.

## Proof of Concept

### Setup

1. Clone or unzip the PoC repository.
2. Run Go tests locally (no network calls required):

```bash
go test ./poc/vuln -v
go test ./fix -v
```

### Code summary

#### Vulnerable version (`poc/vuln/sched.go`)

```go
actives = append(actives, p) // BUG: added even if inactive
```

#### Fixed version (`fix/sched_fixed.go`)

```go
if !listed || !proposer.Active {
    return nil, errors.New("unauthorized or inactive block proposer")
}
```

### Test (`poc/vuln/poc_test.go`)

```go
func Test_InactiveProposerStillScheduled(t *testing.T) {
    requested := Address("0xAA")
    proposers := []Proposer{
        {Address: Address("0x01"), Active: true},
        {Address: requested, Active: false}, // inactive requested proposer
        {Address: Address("0x02"), Active: true},
    }

    sched, _ := NewSchedulerV1(requested, proposers)

    found := false
    for _, p := range sched.Actives {
        if p.Address == requested {
            found = true
        }
    }

    if !found {
        t.Fatalf("inactive proposer not found (expected bug)")
    }
    t.Logf("Inactive proposer present in actives -> bug confirmed")
}
```

### Expected output

```
=== RUN   Test_InactiveProposerStillScheduled
--- PASS: Test_InactiveProposerStillScheduled (0.00s)
    poc_test.go:27: PoC success: inactive proposer present in actives -> bug confirmed
PASS
```

### Fixed behavior

After applying the patch:

```
=== RUN   Test_InactiveProposerRejected
--- PASS: Test_InactiveProposerRejected (0.00s)
    fixed_test.go:15: Fixed behavior: rejected inactive proposer (unauthorized or inactive block proposer)
PASS
```
